## Live demo
Our latest build is live at https://opensuse.github.io/openSUSE-docs-revamped-temp/.

## /!\ Disclaimer
This repository is the workbench for the upcoming Tumbleweed/Leap community user guides and documentation, designed to complement the Leap documentation available at https://doc.opensuse.org.

## About
Take a look at the "About" section (right panel). You can also check [this](https://news.opensuse.org/2020/10/12/join-our-team-and-help-us-imporove-the-openSUSE-learning-experience/) out for context. If you wonder why we are doing this when there is already an official documentation along with wikis, the answer is two-fold:
* wikis make it difficult to sort the outdated / unofficial stuff from the up-to-date / official stuff
* the official docs is slightly outdated, provides too little recommendations or best-practice advices on top of technical facts, is tedious to navigate at times and does not cater for Tumbleweed users.

We are therefore working with people from the official docs to move to a maintainer-centric model, which we believe will better serve the openSUSE community.
