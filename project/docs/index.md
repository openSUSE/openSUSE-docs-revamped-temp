## Foreword

This documentation is created and scoped differently than the [documentation for openSUSE Leap](https://doc.opensuse.org/#opensuse-leap-153) which primarily inherits contents from documentation for commercial SUSE distributions. This means:

* This documentation is curated and maintained by openSUSE volunteers.

* Despite our best efforts, inaccuracies and oversights are possible. Please [report them to us](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-docs-revamped-temp/issues), ideally along with suggested improvements.

* Adhere to disclaimers and admonitions in this documentation. They have been placed to provide a safe path (or at least a safer path). Be aware that openSUSE contributors cannot support every software feature and every combination of software.

* openSUSE Tumbleweed follows a rolling release model. Software and procedures evolve significantly faster than their equivalents for openSUSE Leap. We try to respond quickly to changes, but in some cases, contents may not reflect the most recent updates to openSUSE Factory.
This documentation may also describe procedures using software from openSUSE Factory, representing a state before automated QA and full integration.


## Audience
### New users
The documentation is laid out in a user friendly way. It caters to beginners and other people new to Linux, and helps you get running quickly. Installing Linux can seem daunting at first, because there are a lot of new concepts, choices, and options. Choice is good, but it can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing.

Initially, the installation instruction will cover only the necessary options and configuration choices to help you quickly set up a running system with defaults suitable for daily use. With the system running and productive you can learn how to perform different routine system tasks such as installing apps, adjusting the system settings, or customizing openSUSE. And, if you're so inclined, start honing your Linux skills.

### Experienced users
For experienced Linux users the documentation includes short pointers on how things are done in
openSUSE and how things are different to other Linux distros. Links to advanced topics are provided to get you acquainted with the system, and quickly up and running.

## Summary
This documentation has three main parts. Each part (and most sections within it) can be read independently from the rest and can be used as a guide for accomplishing a specific task. However we have tried to make each part into a coherent whole, which can thus be read in a more linear fashion, in the order in which the contents are presented.

### Part I: Before installing
The pre-install documentation gives you everything you need to get a system running. This can be a simple installation using default settings, or you can make a few choices, such as choosing a desktop environment. You can find out more about things like desktop environments in this section.

__Choosing a distribution__

For experienced users, this section describes what differentiates openSUSE from other distros, and helps you get to know the unique features and make informed choices during the install process.

__Preparing the installation media__

All you need to know to download, verify and install an Installation Image, as well as prepare and boot to the installation media.

### Part II: Installation

__Step by step guide__

Now that you have a plan, this section will walk you through preparing installation media, and performing the installation based on the choice you made during pre-install.

### Part III: Post installation

__Distro basics__

This part contains walk-throughs for the different features of Linux in general and openSUSE in particular. It covers the user interface, system settings, installing and upgrading software, and general good computing practices. You will also learn how to use unique openSUSE features like YaST and snapshots. It is broken down into several main sections:

- KDE Plasma basics
- GNOME basics
- Interlude -- Fundamental openSUSE concepts
- Additional software
- Troubleshooting with autonomy

__Completing and fine-tuning your setup__

- Audio & Video:
- Graphic Drivers: 
- Setting up a containerized environment
- Power management: power.md
- Pairing, syncing, sharing
- Advanced fine-tunings
        
__Giving back to the community__

- The art of reporting bugs
- Resources
- Other sources of documentation
- Contribute to this docs
- A contributor's checklist
